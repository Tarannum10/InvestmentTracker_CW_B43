Investment Portfolio Tracker
Context:
With the growing popularity of stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other asset types, investors need a user-friendly tool to track and manage their investments. A portfolio tracker provides an overview of their holdings and helps them make informed decisions by presenting real-time data and performance analytics.

Project Goal:
Develop a sleek and responsive investment portfolio tracker where users can add and manage various assets (stocks, crypto, etc.), and view real-time performance data in an intuitive dashboard.

Key Frontend Features
1. Portfolio Overview Dashboard
Feature Description: Design an interactive dashboard that gives users a real-time snapshot of their portfolio's performance. The dashboard should visually display portfolio distribution and track asset performance over time.
Frontend Focus:
Dynamic Pie Charts & Line Graphs: Implement dynamic pie charts that visualize portfolio distribution by asset type (e.g., stocks, bonds, crypto). Create real-time updating line graphs to track asset performance trends, showing fluctuations over time.
Interactive Data Points: Allow users to hover over or click on specific sections of the charts/graphs to reveal detailed data points, such as the total investment, daily/weekly performance, and asset allocation percentages.
Real-Time Updates: Ensure that the dashboard provides real-time data by integrating with external APIs for live market data. Display changes instantly with smooth animations and transitions to update chart visuals.
2. Interactive Asset Management
Feature Description: Allow users to manage their portfolio by adding/removing assets, customizing the layout, and viewing detailed information for each asset.
Frontend Focus:
Draggable Widgets: Implement a modular interface with draggable widgets, allowing users to personalize their portfolio dashboard. Widgets might include stock tickers, crypto performance, or news feeds. Users can drag-and-drop widgets to arrange the layout according to their preferences.
Detailed Asset View: When a user clicks on an asset, provide an in-depth view with real-time price updates, performance charts, and market trends. Include additional analytics, like daily percentage changes, historical performance, and comparison with market benchmarks.
Customization Options: Include options for users to customize which data points they want to see for each asset, such as price history, volume, or technical indicators. Enable smooth, animated transitions between different views or asset details.
3. Responsive Asset Filters
Feature Description: Build a responsive filtering system that allows users to sort and categorize their assets based on different criteria, offering a customizable view of their portfolio.
Frontend Focus:
Asset Type & Performance Filters: Design a responsive filtering interface where users can sort their portfolio by asset type (e.g., stocks, crypto, bonds) or performance metrics (e.g., highest gain, lowest loss). Implement smooth transitions between filtered views, with the ability to combine multiple filters.
Search & Grouping Features: Include a real-time search bar and grouping options that let users easily find specific assets within their portfolio. Allow assets to be grouped by categories (e.g., sector, market cap) with expandable/collapsible sections for easy navigation.
Animations & Visual Feedback: Use subtle animations to enhance the experience, such as fading in/out when applying filters or expanding/collapsing asset categories. Provide visual feedback when sorting or filtering, like highlighting the top-performing assets in the list.
4. Performance Comparison Tool (Optional)
Feature Description: Allow users to compare the performance of their assets against other benchmarks or individual stocks and cryptocurrencies.
Frontend Focus:
Side-by-Side Comparisons: Build a comparison feature where users can select two or more assets and compare their performance on the same chart. Display metrics such as growth percentage, volatility, and historical returns.
Performance Benchmarks: Enable users to compare their assets against major benchmarks (e.g., S&P 500, BTC price). Use different line colors and styles to visually differentiate between assets and benchmarks on the charts.
